A turn server implemented pure in rust. Compared with coturn, the advantage is that it provides better performance. It can reach a decoding speed of 5Gib/s in a single thread, and the forwarding delay is less than 35 microseconds. However, it does not provide the same With rich functional support like coturn, this project is most suitable for scenarios where stun/turn servers are used in webrtc.

## Features

- The transport layer supports tcp and udp protocols, and supports binding multiple network cards or interfaces.
- You can use the WebHooks api, and the turn server can actively notify external services of some events and use external authentication mechanisms. <sup>([`hooks-api`])</sup>
- External control API, external parties can actively control the turn server and manage sessions. <sup>([`controller-api`])</sup>
- Static authentication lists can be used in configuration files.
- Only long-term authentication mechanisms are supported.
- Only virtual ports are always allocated and no real system ports are occupied.

## Usage

> The versions on crates.io and docker may be very outdated. It is recommended to compile directly from the github source code.

```bash
cargo install turn-server
```

Start with configuration file:

```bash
turn-server --config=/etc/turn_server/config.toml
```

Please check the example configuration file for details: [turn_server.toml](./turn_server.toml)  
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/mycrl/turn-rs/wiki/Configuration) for a description of the configuration file.


#### Docker

```bash
// docker hub
docker pull quasipaa/turn-server
// github packages
docker pull ghcr.io/mycrl/turn-server
```
The custom configuration file overrides the `/etc/turn-server/config.toml` path inside the image through `-v`.

#### Linux service

```
./install-service.sh
```

This will compile the project and install and start the service.


## Building

#### Prerequisites

You need to install the Rust toolchain, if you have already installed it, you can skip it, [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then get the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mycrl/turn-rs
```

#### Build workspace

Compile the entire workspace in release mode:

```bash
cd turn-rs
cargo build --release
```

After the compilation is complete, you can find the binary file in the `"target/release"` directory.
