    /// Figure 1 shows a typical deployment.  In this figure, the TURN client
    /// and the TURN server are separated by a NAT, with the client on the
    /// private side and the server on the public side of the NAT.  This NAT
    /// is assumed to be a "bad" NAT; for example, it might have a mapping
    /// property of "address-and-port-dependent mapping" (see [RFC4787]).
    ///
    /// The client talks to the server from a (IP address, port) combination
    /// called the client's "host transport address".  (The combination of an
    /// IP address and port is called a "transport address".)
    ///
    /// The client sends TURN messages from its host transport address to a
    /// transport address on the TURN server that is known as the "TURN
    /// server transport address".  The client learns the TURN server
    /// transport address through some unspecified means (e.g.,
    /// configuration), and this address is typically used by many clients
    /// simultaneously.
    ///
    /// Since the client is behind a NAT, the server sees packets from the
    /// client as coming from a transport address on the NAT itself.  This
    /// address is known as the client's "server-reflexive transport
    /// address"; packets sent by the server to the client's server-reflexive
    /// transport address will be forwarded by the NAT to the client's host
    /// transport address.
    ///
    /// The client uses TURN commands to create and manipulate an ALLOCATION
    /// on the server.  An allocation is a data structure on the server.
    /// This data structure contains, amongst other things, the relayed
    /// transport address for the allocation.  The relayed transport address
    /// is the transport address on the server that peers can use to have the
    /// server relay data to the client.  An allocation is uniquely
    /// identified by its relayed transport address.
    ///
    /// Once an allocation is created, the client can send application data
    /// to the server along with an indication of to which peer the data is
    /// to be sent, and the server will relay this data to the intended peer.
    /// The client sends the application data to the server inside a TURN
    /// message; at the server, the data is extracted from the TURN message
    /// and sent to the peer in a UDP datagram.  In the reverse direction, a
    /// peer can send application data in a UDP datagram to the relayed
    /// transport address for the allocation; the server will then
    /// encapsulate this data inside a TURN message and send it to the client
    /// along with an indication of which peer sent the data.  Since the TURN
    /// message always contains an indication of which peer the client is
    /// communicating with, the client can use a single allocation to
    /// communicate with multiple peers.
    ///
    /// When the peer is behind a NAT, the client must identify the peer
    /// using its server-reflexive transport address rather than its host
    /// transport address.  For example, to send application data to Peer A
    /// in the example above, the client must specify 192.0.2.150:32102 (Peer
    /// A's server-reflexive transport address) rather than 203.0.113.2:49582
    /// (Peer A's host transport address).
    ///
    /// Each allocation on the server belongs to a single client and has
    /// either one or two relayed transport addresses that are used only by
    /// that allocation.  Thus, when a packet arrives at a relayed transport
    /// address on the server, the server knows for which client the data is
    /// intended.
    ///
    /// The client may have multiple allocations on a server at the same
    /// time.

    /// at least once every hour during the lifetime of the allocation.  The
    /// server uses the mechanism described in Section 9.2 of [RFC8489] to
    /// indicate that it supports [RFC8489].
    ///
    /// All requests after the initial Allocate must use the same username as
    /// that used to create the allocation to prevent attackers from
    /// hijacking the client's allocation.
    ///
    /// Specifically, if:
    ///
    /// * the server requires the use of the long-term credential mechanism,
    ///   and;
    ///
    /// * a non-Allocate request passes authentication under this mechanism,

    ///
    /// * the request does not use the same username as used to create the
    ///   allocation,
    ///
    /// then the request MUST be rejected with a 441 (Wrong Credentials)
    /// error.
    ///
    /// When a TURN message arrives at the server from the client, the server
    /// uses the 5-tuple in the message to identify the associated
    /// allocation.  For all TURN messages (including ChannelData) EXCEPT an
    /// Allocate request, if the 5-tuple does not identify an existing
    /// allocation, then the message MUST either be rejected with a 437
    /// Allocation Mismatch error (if it is a request) or be silently ignored
    /// (if it is an indication or a ChannelData message).  A client
    /// receiving a 437 error response to a request other than Allocate MUST

    ///
    /// [RFC8489] defines a number of attributes, including the SOFTWARE and
    /// FINGERPRINT attributes.  The client SHOULD include the SOFTWARE
    /// attribute in all Allocate and Refresh requests and MAY include it in
    /// any other requests or indications.  The server SHOULD include the
    /// SOFTWARE attribute in all Allocate and Refresh responses (either
    /// success or failure) and MAY include it in other responses or
    /// indications.  The client and the server MAY include the FINGERPRINT
    /// attribute in any STUN-formatted messages defined in this document.
    ///
    /// TURN does not use the backwards-compatibility mechanism described in
    /// [RFC8489].
    ///
    /// TURN, as defined in this specification, supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
    /// IPv6 support in TURN includes IPv4-to-IPv6, IPv6-to-IPv6, and IPv6-
    /// to-IPv4 relaying.  When only a single address type is desired, the
    /// REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute is used to explicitly request the
    /// address type the TURN server will allocate (e.g., an IPv4-only node
    /// may request the TURN server to allocate an IPv6 address).  If both
    /// IPv4 and IPv6 are desired, the single ADDITIONAL-ADDRESS-FAMILY
    /// attribute indicates a request to the server to allocate one IPv4 and
    /// one IPv6 relay address in a single Allocate request.  This saves
    /// local ports on the client and reduces the number of messages sent
    /// between the client and the TURN server.
    ///
    /// By default, TURN runs on the same ports as STUN: 3478 for TURN over
    /// UDP and TCP, and 5349 for TURN over (D)TLS.  However, TURN has its
    /// own set of Service Record (SRV) names: "turn" for UDP and TCP, and
    /// "turns" for (D)TLS.  Either the DNS resolution procedures or the
    /// ALTERNATE-SERVER procedures, both described in Section 7, can be used
    /// to run TURN on a different port.
    ///
    /// To ensure interoperability, a TURN server MUST support the use of UDP
    /// transport between the client and the server, and it SHOULD support
    /// the use of TCP, TLS-over-TCP, and DTLS-over-UDP transports.
    ///
    /// When UDP or DTLS-over-UDP transport is used between the client and
    /// the server, the client will retransmit a request if it does not
    /// receive a response within a certain timeout period.  Because of this,
    /// the server may receive two (or more) requests with the same 5-tuple
    /// and same transaction id.  STUN requires that the server recognize
    /// this case and treat the request as idempotent (see [RFC8489]).  Some
    /// implementations may choose to meet this requirement by remembering
    /// all received requests and the corresponding responses for 40 seconds
    /// (Section 6.3.1 of [RFC8489]).  Other implementations may choose to
    /// reprocess the request and arrange that such reprocessing returns
    /// essentially the same response.  To aid implementors who choose the
    /// latter approach (the so-called "stateless stack approach"), this
    /// specification includes some implementation notes on how this might be
    /// done.  Implementations are free to choose either approach or some
    /// other approach that gives the same results.
    ///
    /// To mitigate either intentional or unintentional denial-of-service
    /// attacks against the server by clients with valid usernames and
    /// passwords, it is RECOMMENDED that the server impose limits on both
    /// the number of allocations active at one time for a given username and

    /// (Allocation Quota Exceeded) (see Section 7.2), and since UDP does not
    /// include a congestion control mechanism, it should discard application
