/// process send indication request
///
/// When the server receives a Send indication, it processes as per
/// [Section 5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8656#section-5) plus 
/// the specific rules mentioned here.
/// 
/// The message is first checked for validity.  The Send indication MUST
/// contain both an XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute and a DATA attribute.  If
/// one of these attributes is missing or invalid, then the message is
/// discarded.  Note that the DATA attribute is allowed to contain zero
/// bytes of data.
/// 
/// The Send indication may also contain the DONT-FRAGMENT attribute.  If
/// the server is unable to set the DF bit on outgoing UDP datagrams when
/// this attribute is present, then the server acts as if the DONT-
/// FRAGMENT attribute is an unknown comprehension-required attribute
/// (and thus the Send indication is discarded).
/// 
/// The server also checks that there is a permission installed for the
/// IP address contained in the XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute.  If no such
/// permission exists, the message is discarded.  Note that a Send
/// indication never causes the server to refresh the permission.
/// 
/// The server MAY impose restrictions on the IP address and port values
/// allowed in the XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute; if a value is not allowed,
/// the server silently discards the Send indication.
/// 
/// If everything is OK, then the server forms a UDP datagram as follows:
/// 
/// *  the source transport address is the relayed transport address of
/// the allocation, where the allocation is determined by the 5-tuple
/// on which the Send indication arrived;
/// 
/// *  the destination transport address is taken from the XOR-PEER-
/// ADDRESS attribute;
/// 
/// *  the data following the UDP header is the contents of the value
/// field of the DATA attribute.
/// 
/// The handling of the DONT-FRAGMENT attribute (if present), is
/// described in Sections [14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8656#section-14) 
/// and [15](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8656#section-15).
/// 
/// The resulting UDP datagram is then sent to the peer.
